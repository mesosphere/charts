# When installing addons on a cluster that already has kudo crds
# installed this value should be set to false. This is necessary because
# CRDs and Webhook (APIService) objects are cluster wide global scoped
# without a namespace. That prevents to install 2 webhook configurations
# for 2 instances of cert-manager.
