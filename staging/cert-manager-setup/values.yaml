# When installing addons on a cluster that already has cert-manager
# installed with webhook validation enabled this value should be set to
# false. This is necessary because CRDs and Webhook (APIService) objects
# are cluster wide global scoped without a namespace. That prevents to
# install 2 webhook configurations for 2 instances of cert-manager.
#
# This will work only in case when a cert-manager is installed in
# `cert-manager` namespace.
