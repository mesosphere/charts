The following directories have been created on worker nodes:

{{- range .Values.storageclasses }}
/mnt/{{ .name }}
{{- end }}

The directory names match their corresponding storage classes.
By mounting volumes into these directories, they will be made available
as persistent volume in their respective storage class.
