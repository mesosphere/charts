# For upgrades from 2.11.1 to 2.12.3 (AKA DKP 2.5 to DKP 2.6)
# To avoid unnecessarily rerunning the Jobs during upgrade within 2.6, select using the helm chart
# version label to only delete the Jobs if they are on dex 2.11.1 (version shipped in DKP 2.5).
# Delete the Jobs created by the dex chart prior to upgrading. Priority class was added
# to Job specs, which is an immutable field and requires the Job to be
# deleted and recreated. After this release, we can remove the pre-upgrade hook.
