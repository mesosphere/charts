# For upgrades to 2.12.3+.
# Delete the Jobs created by the dex chart prior to upgrading. Priority class was added
# to Job specs, which is an immutable field and requires the Job to be
# deleted and recreated. After this release, we can remove this pre-upgrade hook because
# TTL will be set on the Job to automatically clean it up after it runs.
