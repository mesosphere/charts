# Reviewer and approver configuration for charts.
# Implemented using GitHub's CODEOWNERS file.
# All repos are to require TWO approvals before merge.
# Reference: https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners
# Order is important: later rules override preceding rules

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo unless a later match takes precedence
